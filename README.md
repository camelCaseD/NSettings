# NSettings

This is a Android application built originally for Gingerbread (2.3 API 10). It was an attempt to create a way to quickly manage system settings without having to navigate the horribly laid out (at the time) system settings app. This was accomplished by displaying a notification that when tapped would display a dialog with toggles and sliders to mange certain system settings.
